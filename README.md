### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labds did prepare me to complete the assignment. The topics such as adding APIs, using querySelector, getElementById, addEventListener were all used in this project. Learning these topics helped me greatly for completing this project. THere were not any features in the weekly assignments that did not make me feel unprepared to complete.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would add more functionality and accessibility features to the website, like adding pop-ups for a more detailed explanation on the movies. I would also like to add runtime and a trailer to the dialog boxes.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The HTML coding of the website went well. Though, there were a few problems that arose as I coded the JavaScript and the CSS. Figuring out how to load more movies when the load button was pressed, having the search feature show movies that were related to the search filter were all things that had me think and seek for help. When heading for help from peers, I realized many of the ways I was going about solving these problems were very robust and headed in a very roundabout solution. So seeing and noticing how they approached the problems were very helpful and I would like to try next time.
